InPixio Photo Eraser has several features that make it stand out from other photo editing software. Here are some of them:
 
- Erase function: This function lets you remove any object or person from your photo without any loss of quality. The erase slider features automatic detection of color contrasts, assisting you at any point in your path.
- Correction Patch: This tool allows you to get rid of imperfections, fill in or clone part of the image with just one flick of the mouse. It makes it easier to touch up areas that are hard to reconstruct. It can remove or add elements, even in areas that are very difficult to rebuild (steps, shading in the sky, etc.).
- Clone Tool: This tool lets you perfect your editing or clone contrasting features. Existing objects can be redrawn on the screen with the cloning stamp. Repeat this process as often as you like to create amazing double effects.
- Duplication with opacity: This function makes it possible to accentuate or attenuate the presence of features in your photos.
- Cropping and 90Â° Rotation: This feature lets you set the ratio of your photos yourself (1/1, 4/3, 16/9 etc.), then adjust the angle by drawing a horizontal line on your photo.
- Mini Tooltips videos: To get the most out of Photo Eraser features, mini videos have been added to each of the software program's modules in the form of tooltips, making it easier and more effective to use.
- Help Tool: A detailed and regularly updated database is now accessible in one click from the interface. This resource anticipates potential user questions and provides complete answers, once again to offer improved assistance.
- Video tutorials: To help you get the best out of the features of Photo Studio, tutorials have been added to a new section for user support, providing a simpler and more effective way to get started.
